# Contributing to pyMDOC-CBOR

This is a fork of the original project [pyMDOC-CBOR](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pyMDOC-CBOR). It is published to github, and mirrored in gitlab.

The goal would be to contribute with most of changes to the original project, but in case this is not possible, this fork will be maintained:

Branches:

* `main`: Every change that is compatible with the original project will be merged into this branch.
* `release`: This branch will contain non-compatible changes and it will be used to publish releases to local PyPI.

Changes:

* Remove pin to `cbor2` dependency.

Roadmap:

* Remove pin to `cbor2-diag` dependency.
